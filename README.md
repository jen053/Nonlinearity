# Transient Wave Dynamic Acousto Elastic Testing (TW-DAET)
### Dependence of Elastic Nonlinearity on Aligned Inhomogeneities
The following GitHub repository collects data, documentation, programs, and figures put together during Jacob Newman's M.Sc. (geophysics) research project. The thesis, in its entirety, can be found in the "Thesis" directory; we provide an abstract below.

We have shared this repository and all its contents to encourage Open Science to drive further the continuation of research on elastic nonlinearity in geomaterials and incentive Open Science in general. We provide all the data, programs, and figures included in the thesis here.

## Abstract
The nonlinear elasticity of geomaterials is a prominent indicator of the materials' internal structure (micro-fractures, grain-to-grain boundaries, etc.), both microscopically and macroscopically. Dynamic acousto-elastic testing (DAET) has become a standard tool to assess the nonlinear elasticity of materials. Here, we use a transient wave variation of DAET (TW-DAET) to evaluate whether this type of testing can (1) distinguish the presence of varying types of inhomogeneities and (2) determine the direction in which said inhomogeneities align. We explore two main types of inhomogeneities with TW-DAET; micro-fracturing in sandstone samples (which we attempt to induce via freeze-thaw cycles) and embedded objects within an elastically linear background cement. The sandstone results remain largely inconclusive though evidence for a potential two-mechanism (one increasing and one decreasing nonlinearity) system presents itself in a subset of the data. We can observe the presence and alignment of inhomogeneities for a part of the cement samples we examine with TW-DAET. We also find evidence for a potential nonlinearity dependence on the relationship between the wavelength of the probe and the spatial characteristics of the inhomogeneities.
