# Transient Wave Dynamic Acousto Elastic Testing (TW-DAET)
### Dependence of elastic nonlinearity on aligned inhomogeneities
The following GitHub repository is a collection of data, documentation, codes, and figures put together during Jacob Newman's M.Sc. (geophysics) research project. The thesis in its entirety can be found 
in the "Thesis" directory; an abstract is provide below.

This reporsitory and all its contents have been shared to incourage Open Science both to further drive the continuation of research on elastic nonlinearity in geomaterials as well as to incentive Open 
Science in general. All the data, codes, and figures included in the thesis are provides here.
